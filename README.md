# Task manager
A task manager can be very useful when it comes to organizing our daily and weekly activities and commitments.

Personally, I usually use task managers, however, over time I stop using them due to their multiple functions that make it complex or, on the other hand, the lack of these functions.

That is why I have decided to carry out this project, in this way I can customize my solution based on my needs.
